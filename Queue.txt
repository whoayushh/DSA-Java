-linear data structure
-follows FIFO
-operations:
   enqueue
   dequeue

- In Java, you can implement queues using various classes and interfaces provided in the Java Collections Framework.
- main interfaces are 'Queue' and its sun-interface 'Deque'.

- using Queue interface
Queue<String> que = new LinkedList<>();

-using Deque interface:
Deque<string> dq = new  ArrayDeque<>();  // or LinkedListDeque<>

LinkedListDeque is a wrapper around LinkedList. 


TIME COMPLEXITY:
enqueue(e): O(1)
dequeue():    O(N) (worst case, when queue is empty)
peek/element:O(1)
